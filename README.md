### Introduction to course
The plummeting cost of DNA sequencing has revolutionized our understanding of bacteria, particularly those that make a living as pathogens or symbionts of plants. In particular, we have learned that the bacterial genes involved in adapting to their hosts are often on transmissible elements that can evolve differently than the rest of the genome. This special topics course will offer a practical introduction to bacterial draft genome sequencing using low-cost Illumina technology, including hands-on bioinformatics skills to assemble, annotate, and analyze genomic sequencing data. The course will also involve engaging with the primary literature and formulating novel scientific hypotheses that students will be able to test with existing datasets.
